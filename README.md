# Twitter Sentinel â€“ A Networks Backed Approach to Controlling Fake News

## Introduction

The Twitter platform is widely used for news consumption, but misinformation and echo chambers are significant concerns. Fake news spreads faster and wider than factual information on Twitter, causing polarization in politics. To address this, a control and mitigation mechanism is needed to identify influential accounts, understand their nature, and take appropriate actions against malicious intent. The team aims to disrupt the spread of fake news by limiting the activity of infected nodes. The study utilizes the FakeNewsNet dataset, specifically the Politifact subset, and employs Python for data processing.

## High Level Approach


The team's approach and toolkit for addressing the problem are summarized as follows:

- Data insights: Utilizing TigerGraph for creating a master dataframe and extracting key statistics. Data mining techniques such as MapReduce, NetworkX, and iGraph are employed to represent the data in node-edge form as per package requirements.

- Communities and points of influence: Identification of communities and influential nodes using techniques like Leading Eigenvector and Asynchronous Label Propagation.

- Identification of malignant communities and nodes: Utilizing Fluid Communities and Kernighan Lin Maximization to identify malicious communities and nodes.

- Disruption of malignant communities: Disabling malicious communities by limiting the activity of the fewest number of nodes possible. Spark GraphFrames and targeted attack based on the highest degree are employed for this purpose.

## Insights

- The spread of fake news is effectively represented through relationships between tweets and retweets.
- Targeted attacks based on vertex degree are highly efficient in disrupting the spread of fake news, resulting in a 40% reduction on average. This approach is particularly valuable from a business perspective as it disrupts the flow of fake news while minimizing the overall impact on the network.
